### Data:
- data.csv
- master.csv
- processed_master.csv (same data as master.csv but different name)
(The original data that was downloaded from Kaggle was data.csv. After processing our data, we created the master.csv, which is the data we used to fit the various models.)

### Preprocessing data:
- Preprocession.ipynb

- suicide_by_GDP.ipynb 
- suicide_by_GDP.html
(scatterplot between GDP per capita and suicide number/100k population, top 10 countries with highest mean suicide rate, line chart for GDP per capita and suicide rate over time, regression plot between GDP per capita and suicide rate in top 10 countries)
- suicide_by_age_and_generation.ipynb
