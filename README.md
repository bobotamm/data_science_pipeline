### Data:
- data.csv
- master.csv
- processed_master.csv (same data as master.csv but different name)
(The original data that was downloaded from Kaggle was data.csv. After processing our data, we created the master.csv, which is the data we used to fit the various models.)

### Preprocessing data:
- Preprocession.ipynb

### EDA:
- suicide_by_gender.ipynb 
- suicide_by_gender.html
(boxplot and QQ plot of suicide by gender. Scatter plot of suicide by year, female suicide by year, and male suicide by year)
- suicide_by_GDP.ipynb 
- suicide_by_GDP.html
- suicide_by_age_and_generation.ipynb
- suicide_by_age_and_generation.html
(Subplots of Scatterplots for Age and Generation)

### Data Modeling:
- linear_regression.ipynb
- linear_regression.html
(fitting linear regression model with processed data)
- PolynomialRegression.ipynb
- PolynomialRegression.html
(fitting polynomial regression model using linear regressor and SGD regressor with processed data)
- ensemble_regression.ipynb 
- ensemble_regression.html
